I am a second-year master's student from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Florida. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Hohai University in 2023.

I am very passionate about GoLang, Python, and Kubernetes(k8s). I am also highly motivated to deepen my knowledge in discrete mathematics and algorithms. 

**Now, I’m actively seeking internship or full-time opportunities to Software Development Engineer or Cloud Engineer from Fall 2024.**
